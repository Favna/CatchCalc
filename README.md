# CatchCalc

CatchCalc is a simple in Java written program that can calculate the chance of capture a pokémon given the pokémon Max HP and current HP. While a couple of steps are still required to actually know these values (one method explained below), it is wishful thinking to hope that in a future game we'll actually be able to see values rather than green bars.
